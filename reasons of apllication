I am student and I don't have any special source of income I was in governmental school which means that i had a free educational in my country.I don't really have money to afford joining top world universities,i had no job and my family income low.All tutorials are easy to understand. Tutors are also experienced. I have no well-skilled teachers so i need help of coursera about data science and deep learning with tensorflow. I want to increase my programming knowledge, I'm eager to work and to advance in my career. I had great experience with Coursera courses that I successfully completed previously and I really increased my programming knowledge so far on Coursera. Getting better in programming, which is my every day goal, requires constant learning and constant improving.I hope you will allow me to complete this course and cosider my financial inabilities.
I plan on adding any certificates I've attained to all of my applications/resume.

I need all the help I can get to land a job, Tricky to prove though .

I am doing my thesis on deep learning and neural network.I need broad knowledge about data science with python. Tensorflow is one of the powerful platform for data analysis and visualization. I want to complete your course within a month and this will help me a lot in my thesis work and for deep learning concepts.I have done other python courses too . I will submit all assignment timely and also join to the discuss forum.Git version control is best within teams also I believe, so learning about Git will help me work better in the team working environment. To be good in teamwork is one of my career goals also so learning and understanding git will help me achieve it to.
